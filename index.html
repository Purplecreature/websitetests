            <p>Williamina Fleming was a female astronomer born in 1857, who over the course of her life became well-known for cataloguing hundreds of stars and running the Draper Catalogue project, all while being a single mother. She has also later been accredited with first identifying the Horsehead Nebula and the existence of White Dwarfs.
                <br><br>She advocated for women to go into the field of science, promoting for astronomers to have female assistants, suggesting that if given adequate opportunity women could rival men in scientific fields.

            <p>Fleming was born in Dundee, Scotland, in May 1857 to Mary Walker and Robert Stevens, who was a carver. She was one of nine children, and her father died when she was only nine, so by the age of fourteen she had to act as a student teacher to make money for the family.
                <br><br>When she was 20, she got married to James Orr Fleming, a widower and accountant who was 16 years her senior. She got pregnant quickly, and together they moved to America to start a new life.

            <p>However, their new start did not last. He soon abandoned her and their unborn child, leaving her to have to earn money herself. She became a housekeeper for Professor Edward Pickering, the director of the Harvard College Observatory, who she then named her child after.
            </p>
            <p>Pickering’s wife quickly suggested that Fleming might have talents beyond being a maid, and he reportedly declared to some of his male employees that his maid would’ve done a better job than they had. He then hired her to do part-time administrative work for him, which became a full-time job two years later in 1881.

            <span><p>Fleming became one of the founding members of the Harvard Computers, an all-female group of women employed by Pickering as “human calculators”, to make mathematical calculations, as well as editors for the observatory’s publications. The group contained many future names in astronomy, including Annie Cannon who went on to design the classification system for stars that is still in use now, and Henrietta Leavett who discovered the size of the universe.

                <span class="paras"><p>In 1886 Mary Ann Draper, who was the wealthy widow of astronomer Henry Draper, started the Henry Draper memorial fund to support the Harvard College Observatory (HCO)’s research. With these new funds, they began a project to identify and classify as many stars as possible.
                </p>
                <br><p>Fleming was placed in charge of this project, creating a classification system based on spectra that got called the Pickering-Fleming system. Over the next ten years, she catalogued over 10,000 stars, publishing them in the first edition of the Draper Catalogue. This number increased to over 300,000 over the course of her career.

                </figure>
                <span class="paras"><p>During this classification, she was also able to discover 310 new variable stars (stars whose brightness from Earth changes), 59 gaseous nebulae including the famous Horsehead nebula and 10 novae. Early catalogues including her discoveries omitted her name from credits, and it wasn’t until 1908 when she and her time were well-known enough to be given credit.
                </p>
                <br><p>She was also put in charge of editing all the Harvard Observatory publications, given the title Curator of Astronomical Photographs at Harvard Observatory in 1899. She complained in private about having to spend more time editing other people’s work than getting to do her own. Her work was definitely recognised however, as she was the first American woman elected to honorary membership in the British Royal Astronomical Society, and given the Guadalupe Almendaro by the Astronomical Society of Mexico for her discovery of stars.
                </p></span>
            </div>
            <p>She was even the first person to discover a white dwarf in 1910 - finding that despite being a dim star it was of type A, meaning it was white. Thus opened a new field of study, with two more being found in 1915 and 1917, and being named as white dwarfs in 1922.
            </p>
            <p>She fought for female scientists - giving a talk called ‘A Field For Woman’s Work in Astronomy’ pushing for more women to become astronomers. She argued with Pickering about her salary at points, journaling “I am immediately told that I receive an excellent salary as women’s salaries stand.…Does he ever think that I have a home to keep and a family to take care of as well as the men?…And this is considered an enlightened age!”

            </p><br><p>Annie Cannon, who had worked under her as a Harvard Computer, wrote an obituary for her in the Astrophysical Journal. She described Fleming as someone with a “extremely magnetic personality” who “won friends easily”. She was apparently fond of football, Cannon writing that “there was no more enthusiastic spectator in the stadium for the football games, no more ardent champion of the Harvard eleven”.

            <p class="quote">“Her bright face, her attractive manner, and her cheery greeting with its charming Scotch accent, will long be remembered by even the most casual visitors to the Harvard College Observatory.” - Cannon
